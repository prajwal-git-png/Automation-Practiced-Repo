Excel Utilities and Data-Driven Testing (day40)

Overview
- Purpose: Read/write Excel files to drive tests and persist results.
- Files: ReadFromExcel.java, WriteDataInExcel.java, EditingData.java, DynamicDataInsert.java, Book1.xlsx ... Book4.xlsx

Reading Excel
- Use Apache POI (HSSF/XSSF) to open workbook → sheet → rows → cells.
- Convert cell types safely (string/numeric/boolean/date); handle blanks.

Writing Excel
- Create/modify workbook; write cells; autosize columns; save to file.
- For updates, read existing file, edit in-memory, write back.

Dynamic Data
- Generate data (timestamps, UUIDs) and insert into rows to avoid collisions.

Examples Explained
1) ReadFromExcel.java
- Iterates rows/cells; collects into data structures for test inputs.

2) WriteDataInExcel.java / EditingData.java / DynamicDataInsert.java
- Demonstrates creating sheets, updating cells, and appending new rows.

Good Practices
- Close workbook/streams in finally to prevent file locks.
- Keep test data separate from code; avoid committing secrets.
- Validate file paths and handle Windows path separators.
