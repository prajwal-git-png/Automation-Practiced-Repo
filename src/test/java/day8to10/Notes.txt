Dropdowns, Bootstrap Menus, and Autosuggest (day8to10)

Overview
- Purpose: Interact with select controls, custom dropdowns, and dynamic suggestions.
- Files: DropDowns.java, BootstrapMenu.java, GoogleSearchBar.java

Native Select (<select>)
- Use org.openqa.selenium.support.ui.Select
- APIs: selectByVisibleText, selectByValue, selectByIndex, getOptions, isMultiple
- Validation: Verify selected option(s) match expected.

Custom Dropdowns (Bootstrap/React/etc.)
- Often not a <select>; interact via click on toggle then click item.
- Use stable locator for the menu item text; ensure menu is visible first.

Autosuggest/Typeahead (GoogleSearchBar)
- Type query; wait for suggestions list; iterate items and click match.
- Synchronize with explicit waits for visibility/presence of suggestions.

Examples Explained
1) DropDowns.java
- Shows both native Select usage and custom dropdown clicking.
- Edge cases: scrolling into view before clicking; handling disabled options.

2) BootstrapMenu.java
- Click toggle; wait for menu; choose by text; assert resulting navigation/action.

3) GoogleSearchBar.java
- Enter partial term; capture suggestions; select exact/contains text item.
- Assertion: result page title contains the chosen suggestion.

Good Practices
- Prefer text-based locators for menu items to avoid index brittleness.
- Use waits around opening/closing animations.
- Guard against overlay elements intercepting clicks; scroll if necessary.
