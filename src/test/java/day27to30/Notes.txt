Screenshots and Evidence (day27to30)

Overview
- Purpose: Capture visual evidence for debugging and reporting.
- Files: ScreenShot.java, file/screenshot.png, file/TableScreenshot.png

Capturing Screenshots
- Full page: TakesScreenshot ts = (TakesScreenshot) driver; File src = ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE)
- Element screenshot: element.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE)
- Save with timestamped filenames to avoid overwrites.

Table/Region Screens
- Scroll into view; capture element-only screenshot for precision.

Examples Explained
1) ScreenShot.java
- Wraps reusable method to capture full page or element screenshot.
- Saves under project directory; demonstrates naming conventions.

Good Practices
- Include screenshots on assertion failures.
- Store artifacts in a dedicated folder and clean up regularly.
