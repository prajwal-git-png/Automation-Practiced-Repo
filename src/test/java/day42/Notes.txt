Intro to Test Cases (day42)

Overview
- Purpose: Write basic test cases using Selenium and a testing framework.
- Files: FirstTestCase.java, OrangeHRMtest.java

Test Structure
- Arrange: setup driver and navigate to base URL.
- Act: perform interactions to reach the expected state.
- Assert: verify using title/text/URL/element state.

Examples Explained
1) FirstTestCase.java
- Minimal test that opens a page and validates key UI/text.

2) OrangeHRMtest.java
- Logs into OrangeHRM demo; validates dashboard/home visibility.

Good Practices
- Keep tests atomic and independent.
- Use setup/teardown methods to manage driver lifecycle.
- Add waits only where necessary to keep tests fast.
