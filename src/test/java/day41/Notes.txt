Config Properties and Utilities (day41)

Overview
- Purpose: Externalize configuration and create reusable utilities.
- Files: config.properties, ReadPropertiesFile.java, UtilityAuto.java, ExampleForDataUtility.java, Book1.xlsx

Properties
- Load using java.util.Properties with FileInputStream.
- Access keys for baseUrl, credentials, timeouts, etc.
- Avoid hard-coding; prefer environment-specific files when needed.

Utilities
- Common helpers for waits, screenshots, JS ready checks, data readers.
- Centralize repeated code to reduce duplication in tests.

Examples Explained
1) ReadPropertiesFile.java
- Loads properties; prints/uses values in test setup.

2) UtilityAuto.java / ExampleForDataUtility.java
- Provides wrappers for frequent actions (wait for visibility, click via JS, read Excel row, etc.).

Good Practices
- Validate required keys and provide sensible defaults.
- Keep secrets out of VCS or encrypt them.
- Document all available keys in README.
