Assertions and Annotations (day43)

Overview
- Purpose: Strengthen validation and organize tests using annotations.
- Files: AssertionClassDemo.java, TestAnnotations.java, TestingBeforeclass.java, pack/C1.java, pack/C2.java, pack/C3.java

Assertions
- Hard vs soft assertions; assertEquals/assertTrue/assertFalse/contains.
- Provide clear failure messages for diagnostics.

Annotations
- @BeforeClass/@AfterClass, @BeforeMethod/@AfterMethod for lifecycle hooks.
- @Test(priority=..., enabled=..., description=...)

Examples Explained
1) AssertionClassDemo.java
- Demonstrates multiple assertion types with meaningful messages.

2) TestAnnotations.java / TestingBeforeclass.java
- Shows test lifecycle with setup/teardown per class/method.

3) pack/C1.java, C2.java, C3.java
- Organized examples under a sub-package to illustrate grouping and modularity.

Good Practices
- Keep assertions specific and minimal per test.
- Prefer one logical assertion per test, or group related checks carefully.
- Use descriptions to make reports readable.
